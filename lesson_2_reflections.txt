Initializing a git repo starts a query where we can start making commits

Staging area is where you put the files you want on to one commit, its prep area

I can use staging area to see what files I want to add to a certain commit and what comments I can add to it

If I want to create different versions of the game, then I can create branches to my program.

The diagrams help me know what the 'head' comment means when we checkout.

The result of merging two branches together decreases the clutter.

Automatic can create conflicts cause Git looks at areas of code that are similar.
